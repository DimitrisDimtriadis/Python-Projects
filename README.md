_________________________________

!!! To start on this project you need to install all necessary tools like python3, sqlite3, pip etc. To do that you need to go on folder and run the command bellow:
chmod 755 UtilitiesInstall 


@python vs python3
The app works with python3. If you use python and not the python3, you will face issues !

@To add on infinite loop to execute every X mins we use linux's 'crontab -e' more specific we add the 
line bellow: (Before you enter script to crontab make sure that you have set data.csv)
* * * * * /path to file/shellScriptAggregator.sh
* * * * * /path to file/BackupProcess.sh
